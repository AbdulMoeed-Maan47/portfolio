I am starting my web development journey this semester. It is my first project in the attempt. It is a portfolio project implemented completely in html. I have created multiple pages, and added links to navigate between them.
I have implemented education, experiences, and projects page in the portfolio.
I have tried to put them in appropriate layout by using html semantic tags such as header, footer, main, section, and article.
I have also developed a form to get contact details. It is connected to an action.php file. The action.php file is not implemented yet.
