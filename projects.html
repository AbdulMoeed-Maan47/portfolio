        <h2>What-To-Do</h2>
        <p>
          It is my 1st ever programming project. It was my first semester,
          <b>Programming Fundamentals</b> course project. I made a to-do list
          app in <big>C++</big>. I implemented the concepts of variables,
          conditionals, loops and file handling studied in the class in this
          project. The user can add, remove, update and delete his tasks. Also,
          he can reschedule his tasks. He can mark tasks done and undone.
          Moreover, he can see his over-due tasks along with due today, due
          tomorrow and due later tasks.

        <h2>Banking Management System</h2>
        <p>
          It was my second semester, <b>Object Oriented Programming</b> course
          project. I implemented the concepts of OOP in <big>C++</big> such as
          inheritance, polymorphism, association, aggregation, and composition.
          I implemented multiple classes and associated them via each other. I
          created a menu based project that had separate interface for bankers,
          customers and company employees. Customers can deposit and withdraw
          cash. The banker can approve new customers and assign them a card
          number. The company employees can share a same account.

        <h2>Flappy Bird</h2>
        <p>
          This is my <b>Computer Organization and Assembly Language</b> project.
          I created an animation based game using
          <big>x86 assembly language</big>. I created all the event loops
          myself. Used global variables for configurations and kept the code as
          modular as possible. I implemented flying as well as crash logic.

        <h2>Grubify</h2>
        <p>
          This is my <b>Database Lab</b> project. It was a team project. My team
          members implemented backend and frontend logic in REACT.js and
          Node.js, while I dealt with databases. I worked in <big>MsSQL</big>. I
          created the schema and wrote stored procedures, triggers, views and
          enforced business rules via transactions. At the end, I normalized the
          schema to BCNF.

        <h2>TripMate</h2>
        <p>
          It was my <b>Software Design and Analysis</b> course project. It was
          also a team project. It was an expense tracker and divider app. The
          main focus was to design the system first, then implement it. We
          implemented our project using <big>REACT.js</big> for frontend and
          <big>Flask</big> for backend, with SQLAlchemy for database.

        <h2>summarizeThis</h2>
        <p>
          This was a chat summarization project, using concepts of
          <b>Natural Language Processing</b> in <big>python</big>. We first used
          a bi-LSTM model, which was very bad at this task. Then, we used BERT
          to perform this task and we got pretty good accuracy with fine
          summaries.
