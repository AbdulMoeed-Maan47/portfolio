    <h2>What-To-Do</h2>
    <p>
      It was my 1st ever programming project. It was my first semester,
      <b>Programming Fundamentals</b> course project. I made a to-do list app in
      <big>C++</big>. I implemented the concepts of variables, conditionals,
      loops and file handling studied in the class in this project.

    <h2>Banking Management System</h2>
    <p>
      It was my <b>Object Oriented Programming</b> course project. I implemented
      the concepts of OOP in <big>C++</big> such as inheritance, polymorphism,
      association, aggregation, and composition. I implemented multiple classes
      and associated them via each other. I created a menu based project that
      had separate interface for bankers, customers and company employees.

    <h2>Flappy Bird</h2>
    <p>
      This is my <b>Computer Organization and Assembly Language</b> project. I
      created an animation based game using <big>x86 assembly language</big>. I
      created all the event loops myself. Used global variables for
      configurations and kept the code as modular as possible. I implemented
      flying as well as crash logic

    <h2>Grubify</h2>
    <p>
      This is my <b>Database Lab</b> project. It was a team project. My team
      members implemented backend and frontend logic in REACT.js and Node.js,
      while I dealt with databases. I worked in <big>MsSQL</big>. I created the
      schema and wrote stored procedures, triggers, views and enforced business
      rules via transactions. At the end, I normalized the schema to BCNF.
    </p>

    <h2>TripMate</h2>
    <p>
      It was my <b>Software Design and Analysis</b> course project. It was also
      a team project. It was an expense tracker and divider app. The main focus
      was to design the system first, then implement it. We implemented our
      project using <big>REACT.js</big> for frontend and <big>Node.js</big> for
      backend.
    </p>

    <h2>summarizeThis</h2>
    <p>
      This was a chat summarization project, using concepts of
      <b>Natural Language Processing</b> in <big>python</big>. We first used a
      bi-LSTM model, which was very bad at this task. Then, we used BERT to
      perform this task and we got a pretty good accuracy with fine summaries.
